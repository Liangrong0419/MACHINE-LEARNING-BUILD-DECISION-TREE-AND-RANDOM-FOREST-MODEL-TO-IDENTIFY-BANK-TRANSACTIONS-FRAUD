# MACHINE-LEARNING-BUILD-DECISION-TREE-AND-RANDOM-FOREST-MODEL-TO-IDENTIFY-BANK-TRANSACTIONS-FRAUD
My job is to find fraud, waste, and abuse in the payment stream. I have been presented with a sample dataset of transactions and a holdout set, my job is to walk through the process of exploring the data, building model(s), and evaluating them. My target variable is called EVENT_LABEL and contains a label "legit" or "fraud". My task is to build and compare 3 models (Random Forest, Decision Tree and a Logistic Regression) performances to find the most effective model at predicting EVENT_LABEL. What features where most useful.
